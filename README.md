The Elsa Leo-Rhynie Towers Hall, also referred to as the ELR Towers, stands as a notable student establishment situated at the core of the University of the West Indies (UWI) Mona Campus. Comprising five distinctive towers—The Tower of Olympus, The Tower of Phoenix, The Tower of Apollo, The Tower of Orion, and The Tower of the Mighty Dragons—the hall accommodates more than 600 students each academic year.

Notwithstanding its impressive stature, there exists a pressing necessity for an innovative software solution. Presently, the hall lacks a real-time tracking system for addressing resident concerns, while its laundry system operates in a disorganized and inefficient manner. Furthermore, there is a noticeable absence of a centralized repository for hall maintenance data.
Our extensive automation endeavors are aimed at seamlessly integrating every aspect of the hall's operations, encompassing laundry and resident concerns, to tackle these challenges. This software solution is designed to enrich the living experience of residents by empowering them with enhanced control and transparency in managing their domestic affairs. Additionally, it will support administrative personnel in efficiently managing operations and offering assistance and guidance to residents. This approach underscores our commitment to ensuring that the software remains focused on meeting the needs of students and key hall personnel.
